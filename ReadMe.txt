Description

Project Status
In the game so far, the player will control a character where they will have to traverse across a level consisting of 
falling platforms that will fall when the player has touched one of them. The character moves by using the motion controls of the mouse 
to move in the desired direction. During the level, the player will encounter obstacles that will act as another challenge for the player 
so they will try to avoid falling off the stage. There are also teleporters where the player will be transported to a different section of the game. 

The player will collect points that are located across the stage where the player will have to avoid falling off the level so that they 
can continue to play. If the player falls off the stage, they will collide with an invisible collision box that will allow the character 
to respawn but the player will lose a life in the process. When the player has collected enough points, they will need to collide with 
a cube object that will act as a goal for the player so they can progress to the next stage. However, at the moment, the player will just 
restart the level as there isnâ€™t a second level to progress to yet. There is also a timer at the top of the screen to display how long the 
player has been playing this level for.

Controls:
You use the motion controls of the mouse to move the character.
Middle mouse button: jump
Left and right mouse buttons: Turn the camera
